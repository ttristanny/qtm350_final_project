Preprocessing.py:
This script builds the main analysis dataset by merging several World Bank indicators for five focus countries (Botswana, Azerbaijan, Albania, Colombia, and Fiji) from 1999–2019. It first defines file paths and a helper function load_and_melt() that reads each original CSV, keeps only the selected years and country/code columns, filters to the five countries, and reshapes the wide year-columns into a tidy long format with variables Country Name, Country Code, Year, and the indicator value. In main(), the code applies this function to primary, secondary, and tertiary school enrollment, under-5 mortality, life expectancy, GDP per capita, and employment rate, then outer-merges all seven long tables into a single country–year panel. After a final safety filter to keep only the target countries, it sorts the data by country and year and saves the cleaned, merged dataset as data/living_standards_5countries_1999_2019.csv, which is used by all later analysis scripts.

Tristan.py:
The code loads the dataset, filters observations from 1999–2019, extracts the five countries, and initializes a figure. It loops through each country, sorts yearly data, and plots employment rates. It then adds titles, axis labels, a legend, integer year ticks, and a grid before tightening layout and displaying the final chart.

Fertality.py:
This code analyzes under-5 mortality trends for five countries (Botswana, Azerbaijan, Albania, Colombia, and Fiji) using a merged World Bank dataset. It first loads and filters the data, keeps only the mortality and year variables, removes missing values, and ensures proper numeric formatting. The script then produces three visualizations: a multi-country line plot showing long-term mortality declines and highlighting start/end values, a FacetGrid that displays separate trend lines for each country, and a heatmap that summarizes mortality intensity across countries and years. Together, these plots provide both detailed and comparative views of child health improvements from 1999 to 2019.

life_expectancy_analysis.py:
This script analyzes life expectancy trends using the dataset living_standards_5countries_1999_2019.csv. It begins by importing the necessary libraries (pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, and numpy) and loading the dataset into a DataFrame. The script identifies all countries in the dataset using the unique() function so that each country can be plotted individually.
To visualize changes over time, the script generates a line plot in which each country’s observations are filtered from the DataFrame and plotted with “Year” on the x-axis and “life_expectancy_years” on the y-axis. Labels, markers, and a legend are included to distinguish the countries and clearly display their life expectancy trajectories.
The script then examines overall improvement by comparing life expectancy in 1999 and 2019. It filters the dataset to these two years, reshapes the data with pivot() so that each country has a 1999 and 2019 value side by side, and calculates the improvement as the difference between the two values. A bar chart is produced to show these improvement values and compare how much life expectancy increased in each country over the 20-year period.

qtm350final.py:
This code cleans and visualizes primary, secondary, and tertiary gross enrollment rates for five countries from 1999–2019. The custom function fill_isolated_nans() takes a one-dimensional pandas.Series and scans it with a while loop to identify runs of missing values: if there is exactly one isolated NaN between two valid observations, it replaces that value with the average of its two neighbors; if there are two or more consecutive NaNs, or NaNs at the start or end of the series, they are left unchanged. After loading and filtering the dataset with pandas, the script applies this function country-by-country and column-by-column to the three enrollment variables. Finally, it uses matplotlib.pyplot to produce separate time-series line plots for primary, secondary, and tertiary gross enrollment, showing all five countries on each graph.
