# Qtm350_final_project – Life Expectancy Analysis  
### **Branch:** [Sherry-Life-Expectancy](https://github.com/ttristanny/qtm350_final_project/tree/Sherry-Life-Expectancy)

This branch examines how life expectancy at birth has changed from 1999–2019 across five countries representing different world regions:

- Albania (Europe)  
- Azerbaijan (Asia)  
- Botswana (Africa)  
- Colombia (South America)  
- Fiji (Oceania)

## Indicator  
**Life expectancy at birth, total (years)** – Life expectancy at birth indicates the number of years a newborn infant would live if prevailing patterns of mortality at the time of its birth were to stay the same throughout its life.

## Visualizations
### 1. Life Expectancy Over Time (1999–2019)  
A line plot showing each country’s life expectancy trajectory across the 20-year period.  
This visualization helps identify:

- Broad upward trends in population health  
- Differences in starting life expectancy levels  
- Periods of acceleration or stagnation  
- Regional contrasts in long-term health outcomes  

It provides a clear, continuous view of how longevity has evolved over time.

### 2. Improvement from 1999 to 2019
A bar chart measuring the **total increase in life expectancy** over the dataset window for each country.  
This figure highlights:

- Which countries experienced the greatest improvement  
- Relative health gains across regions  
- Whether changes were modest or substantial  
- Long-term progress in population well-being  

This summary plot complements the time-series chart by focusing on net progress instead of annual variation.
