# Qtm350_final_project – Life Expectancy Analysis  
### **Branch:** [Sherry-Life-Expectancy](https://github.com/ttristanny/qtm350_final_project/tree/Sherry-Life-Expectancy)

This branch examines how life expectancy at birth has changed from 1999–2019 across five countries representing different world regions:

- Albania (Europe)  
- Azerbaijan (Asia)  
- Botswana (Africa)  
- Colombia (South America)  
- Fiji (Oceania)

## Indicator  
**Life expectancy at birth, total (years)** – Life expectancy at birth indicates the number of years a newborn infant would live if prevailing patterns of mortality at the time of its birth were to stay the same throughout its life.

## Visualizations  
`life_expectancy_analysis.py` generates two plots:

1. **Life Expectancy Over Time (1999–2019)**  
2. **Improvement from 1999 to 2019**

## Files  
- `life_expectancy_analysis.py` – Python analysis  
- Figures saved in the `figures/` directory
